## Introduction

This guide explains how routing works in a Next.js application and provides instructions on how to set up and run the application from a Git repository.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of this application is as follows:
```

src/
└── app/
├── about/
│ └── page.tsx
├── blog/
│ ├── first/
│ │ └── page.tsx
│ └── second/
│ └── page.tsx
├── profile/
│ └── page.tsx
└── page.tsx (home route)

````

## Routing in Next.js
In Next.js, the file system is used to define routes. Each file in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory if using the App Router) becomes a route.

### Examples:
- `src/app/page.tsx` is the home route (`/`).
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` is the about route (`/about`).
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` is the profile route (`/profile`).
- `src/app/blog/first/page.tsx` is a nested route under blog (`/blog/first`).
- `src/app/blog/second/page.tsx` is another nested route under blog (`/blog/second`).

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the application up and running.

### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
````

### Switch to the Routing Branch

Navigate to the cloned repository and switch to the `features/routing` branch:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
git checkout features/routing
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Run the Application

Finally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now navigate to different routes defined in the `src/app` directory.

## Conclusion

This guide provided an overview of the routing system in Next.js and detailed steps to set up and run the application. For more information on Next.js routing, refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-name>` with the appropriate values for your repository.
